## General advice for approaching mathematics

- Develop your intuition, it's a powerful skill – But don’t trust it completely
- Don’t aim to memorize but rather seek to understand – It is easy to remember anything when you understand it.
- Question always, be sceptical of all statements presented to you. Don’t
  accept them until you are sure they are believable.
- Observe, question how everything fits together, notice all the details.
- Part of the process of mathematical reasoning is creative - to be creative we must drop our inhibitions and be ready to be wrong, repeatedly.

## Schedule

The material of the course is divided into six parts as listed below. Each part takes two weeks and is accompanied with a set of exercises. Mathematically the parts are intimately linked.

| Topic (2 weeks each)                                         | Teaching period | Instructor |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| [Mechanics of mathematics](/pages/part1.md)                  | 25 Sep - 6 Oct  | Butterley  |
| [Differential calculus in higher dimension](/pages/part2.md) | 9 - 20 Oct      | Butterley  |
| [Extrema and other applications](/pages/part3.md)            | 23 Oct - 3 Nov  | Butterley  |
| [Curves and line integrals](/pages/part4.md)                 | 6 - 17 Nov      | Butterley  |
| [Multiple integrals](/pages/part5.md)                        | 20 Nov - 1 Dec  | Greenblatt |
| [Surfaces and surface integrals](/pages/part6.md)            | 4 - 15 Dec      | Greenblatt |

The final weeks of the course are devoted to a mini-project.

| Project          | Teaching period | Instructor |
