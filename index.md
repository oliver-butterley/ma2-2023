## General advice

- Develop your intuition, it's a powerful skill – But don’t trust it completely
- Don’t aim to memorize but rather seek to understand – It is easy to remember anything when you understand it.
- Question always, be sceptical of all statements presented to you. Don’t
  accept them until you are sure they are believable.
- Observe, question how everything fits together, notice all the details.
- Part of the process of mathematical reasoning is creative - to be creative we must drop our inhibitions and be ready to be wrong, repeatedly.

## Schedule

The material of the course is divided into six parts as listed below. Each part takes two weeks and is accompanied with a set of exercises. Mathematically the parts are intimately linked.

| Topic (2 weeks each)                      | Teaching period | Instructor |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| [Mathematical reasoning](/pages/part1.md) | 25 Sep - 6 Oct  | Butterley  |
| [Higher dimension](/pages/part2.md)       | 9 - 20 Oct      | Butterley  |
| [Extrema](/pages/part3.md)                | 23 Oct - 3 Nov  | Butterley  |
| [Line integrals](/pages/part4.md)         | 6 - 17 Nov      | Butterley  |
| [Multiple integrals](/pages/part5.md)     | 20 Nov - 1 Dec  | Greenblatt |
| [Surface integrals](/pages/part6.md)      | 4 - 15 Dec      | Greenblatt |

The final weeks of the course are devoted to a [mini-project](/pages/project).

| Project          | Teaching period | Instructor |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Project - week 1 | 8-12 Jan        | Greenblatt |
| Project - week 2 | 15-19 Jan       | Butterley  |

- 8 Dec 2023: deadline for agreeing project topic and project team
- 29-30 Jan 2024: project presentations

## What is MA2?

Much of what we do in this course builds on ideas established in Mathematical Analysis 1.
In particular many of the ideas are extended to the higher dimensional setting.
