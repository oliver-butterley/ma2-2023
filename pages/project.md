# Mini projects

## Possible topics

- More in depth with surface integrals
- More in depth with multiple integrals and change of variables
- More in depth with line integrals
- The [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) and hence why having multiple stages improves efficiency
- The geometry of [aerospike engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospike_engine)
- Why are [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point) good places for spacecraft like the [JW space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope)?
- Analysis of [predator-prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) dynamics
- Using [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) in order to verify proofs
- Analysis of electro-magnetic fields
- Didactic methods for rigorous mathematics
- Analysis of [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia#Motion_in_a_fixed_plane), etc for different geometries of wheel design
- Whatever else seems interesting!

## Rules

- The project should demonstrate approximately 20 hours of work per person on topics related to the mathematics of the course
- Projects are carried out in a team of 1,2 or 3 people
- The work of each person in the team must be described

## Schedule

- 8 Jan 2024: deadline for agreeing project topic and project team
- 29-30 Jan 2024: project presentations
