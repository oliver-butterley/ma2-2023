# Mini projects

## Possible topics

- The [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) and hence why having multiple stages improves efficiency
- The geometry of [aerospike engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospike_engine)
- Why are [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point) good places for spacecraft like the [JW space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope)?
- Analysis of [predator-prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) dynamics

## Rules

- The project should demonstrate approximately 20 hours of work on topics related to the mathematics of the course
- Projects are carried out in a team of 1,2 or 3 people
- The work of each person in the team must be described
