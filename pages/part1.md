# Mathematical reasoning

In this part of the course we work on the following skills:

- Understand the precise meanings of mathematical statements and form our own precise statements.
- Manipulate such statements, such as finding contrapositives, inconsistencies, special cases or generalizations.
- Hold several ideas in our heads simultaneously, while keeping track of their truth-values and relationships between each other (which statements are justified by which others? Do any contradict each other?). (particularly in statements with many instances of "for all" and "there exist").
- Understand and form long chains of logical manipulations while quickly identifying and fixing mistakes.
- Justify or find counterexamples to our own guesses.

## Models, definitions, logical consequences?!

## Mathematical statements

Mathematical reasoning proceeds as a sequence of mathematical statements.
Statements are true or false.
E.g., $2+2=4$ is a true statement and $2+2=5$ is a false statement.

Not all combination of words or mathematical symbols is a statement.
E.g.,
$$ =4+\times 4 = - = 3$$
is not a statement, this combination of symbols fails to have meaning.
Similarly 
$$\frac{0}{0} = 1$$
is not a statement since division by zero is not defined.
We say such are _ill-formed_ or _ill-defined_.

Statements may also contain words.
E.g.,
$$\text{There are infinitely many prime numbers}.$$

is a well-formed mathematical statement.

Some statements, e.g.,
$$7=7, \quad 5\leq5$$
are true but are unlikely to be useful.
On the other hand the statement
$$\pi=\frac{22}{7}$$
is false but could be useful.
We could make this a precise statement describing how this is a true approximation.

We say that a combination of symbols such as,
$$2+2$$
is an _expression_, not a statement.
This expression produces a value, it is not something that is true or false.
As with expression, we must work with _well-defined_ or _well-formed_ expressions.
In order to be mathematically rigorous, we must avoid _ill-defined_ or _ill-formed_ expressions, e.g.,
$$1+{2}/{0}, \quad \sin^{-1}(2).$$
We often make statements out of expressions by using relations (e.g., $=$, $<$, $\in$, $\subset$) or by using properties (e.g., "is prime", "is invertible").

_Compound statements_ can be formed from other statements by using logical connectives (e.g., and, or, not, if, "if and only if",...).
We will often do this.

The statement
$$2+2=5 \quad \text{if and only if} \quad 4+4=10$$
is well-formed and true.
Again not very useful.

## Structure of proofs

Be they calculations or logical steps expressed in words, proofs must be a chain of rigorous steps.
The correct conclusion without solid logic is not a proof üòÜ.
Two humorous examples with correct conclusions but which are not proofs:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{16}{64} &= \frac{1\not{6}}{\not{6}4} = \frac{1}{4}, \\
  \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x} &= \frac{d}{d} \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{\not{d}}{\not{d}} \frac{1}{x^2} = - \frac{1}{x^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Typically there are many different ways to write a proof, often very different one to the other.
Here we discuss a few possibilities and introduce some terminology.

### Calculation proofs

These are the classic school mathematics problems, often phrased as "evaluate..." or "calculate...". 
The proof in these cases is simply a chain of equalities to produce the final result.
Since we already have seen so many of these we instead look at a couple of false proofs and practice our skill at searching for gaps and errors in proofs.

::: tip ~~Theorem~~
$5=4$
:::

::: info ~~Proof~~
Since $-20=-20$ we know that
$$25 - 45 = 16 -36,$$
which we can rewrite as
$$5^2 - 5 \times 9 = 4^2 - 4 \times 9.$$
We add $\frac{81}{4}$ on both sides,
$$5^2 - 5 \times 9 + \frac{81}{4} = 4^2 - 4 \times 9 + \frac{81}{4}.$$
These are both perfect squares and so we know that
$$\left(5-\frac{9}{2}\right)^2 = \left(4-\frac{9}{2}\right)^2.$$
Taking the square root of both sides we obtain,
$$5-\frac{9}{2} = 4-\frac{9}{2}$$
which implies that $5=4$.
:::

Alternatively calculations might be more about geometrical reasoning.
When a proof relies on a picture and an appeal to intuition we must be particularly careful with arguments.

::: tip ~~Theorem~~
Every triangle is isosceles.
:::

::: info ~~Proof~~
Start from a triangle $ABC$.
Sketch the triangle and the lines described in the following steps.

- Draw the perpendicular bisector of $BC$, and the angle bisector from $A$.
- Let $I$ be their intersection (if it is not unique, you are done).
- Let $J$ be the projection of $I$ over $AB$, $K$ that over $AC$.
- Considering the right angle triangles $AIJ$ and $AIK$, we see that (lengths) $AJ=AK$, and that $IJ=IK$.
- Then looking at right triangles $BIJ$ and $CIK$, we obtain that $BJ=CK$.
- We conclude that $AB = AJ+JB = AK+KC = AC$.

### Proof by cases

::: tip Theorem
Suppose that $n$ is an integer. Then $n(n+1)$ is an even integer.
:::

::: info Proof
- If $n$ is even, then $n(n+1)$ is also even since the multiple of an even number is even.
- If $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even and so $n(n+1)$ is even, again because the multiple of an even number is even.
- Since $n$ is an integer, $n$ is either even or odd so one of these two cases holds.
:::

Another common scenario is when during a calculation / proof we must consider two cases depending on whether a certain quantity is zero or otherwise we can devide through by this quantity.

### Proof by contradiction

::: tip Problem
Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers and suppose that $xy > 0$ and $x \geq 0$. Show that $y>0$.

::: tip ~~Theorem~~
All sheep are the same colour.
:::

::: info ~~Proof~~
We prove by induction that a group of $N$ sheep are all the same colour.

- The case $N=1$ is immediate because a single sheep is the same colour as itself.

We will now assume that a group of $N$ sheep are all the same colour and consider a group of $N+1$ sheep.

- Removing a single sheep gives a group of $N$ sheep. Removing a different one gives another group of $N$ sheep.
- Within each group all the sheep are the same colour.
- The two groups have $N-1$ sheep in common so both groups are sheep of the same colour as each other and so all of them are the same colour.

## "Tightness" of statement assumptions

- Can we improve some results from Mathematical Analysis 1?
- Can we show that the assumptions of a given statement are required?

## Mathematical analysis

Let's consider some examples which demonstrate some of the motives behind studying analysis in general.

### Series

The geometric series
$S = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots$
can be summed by the following simple trick.
Multiplying by $2$ we obtain that

$$
  2S = 2 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots = 2+S
$$

and so $S=2$.
If we try to do the same to the sum
$T = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \cdots$
we get the nonsensical answer

$$
  2T = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \cdots = T - 1
$$

and so $T = -1$.
Why should we trust the argument in the first case and not in the second?

### Interchanging sums

If we consider any matrix of numbers, for example,

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\
    4 & 5 & 6 \\
    7 & 8 & 9
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

we can sum first the rows $6 + 15 + 24 = 45$ or first the columns $12 + 15 + 18 = 45$ to obtain the total sum of all numbers.
This is the rule

$$
  \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{jk} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m}  a_{jk}.
$$

We would like to believe that also $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{jk} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}  a_{jk}$.
However this doesn't work for the following matrix:

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1      & 0      & 0      & \cdots \\
    -1     & 1      & 0      & \cdots \\
    0      & -1     & 1      & \cdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
  \end{pmatrix}.
$$

We often want to swap the order of summing (or integrating) and often need to consider infinite sums (or integrals).
When can we do this and can't we?

### Interchanging integrals

Let's try to integrate $e^{-xy} - xye^{-xy}$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$.
We would like to believe that

$$
  \int_{0}^{\infty} \left[ \int_{0}^{1} (e^{-xy} - xye^{-xy}) \ dy \right] \ dx
  \overset{\text{\large\color{blue}?}}{=} \int_{0}^{1} \left[ \int_{0}^{\infty}  (e^{-xy} - xye^{-xy}) \ dx \right] \ dy.
$$

Since
$$\int_{0}^{1} (e^{-xy} - xye^{-xy}) \ dy = {\left[ye^{-xy}\right]}_{y=0}^{1} = e^{-x},$$
the left-hand side is equal to
$\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \ dx = {\left[-e^{-x} \right]}_{0}^{\infty} = 1$.

However, since
$$\int_{0}^{\infty} (e^{-xy} - xye^{-xy}) \ dx = {\left[ xe^{-xy} \right]}_{x=0}^{\infty} = 0,$$
the right-hand side is $\int_{0}^{1} 0 \ dx = 0$.
So how do we know when to trust the interchange of intervals? 

### Interchanging limits

We could easily believe that

$$
  \lim_{x\to 0}\lim_{y\to 0} \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}
  \overset{\text{\large\color{blue}?}}{=}
  \lim_{y\to 0}\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}.
$$ 

However 
$$\lim_{y\to 0} \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 0} = 1$$ 
and so the left-hand side is $1$
whereas 
$$\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{0}{0 + y^2} = 0$$ 
so the right-hand side is $0$.

What does the graph of this function look like?
This example shows that the interchange of limits is untrustworthy. Under what circumstances is it legitimate?

We need to be rigorous in our logic otherwise, as we have seen in these examples, the conclusions can be erroneous and the difficulties are often subtle.
