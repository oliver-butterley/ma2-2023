## Exercise

Let $f(x) = (x,x^2,x^3)$ and $g(x,y,z) = x + y -z$.
Identify the domain and codomain of $f$, $g$. Determine if $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ are well defined. If it is well defined then write the function explicitly and determine the domain and codomain.

## Exercise

Let $f(x,y) = x^2 + 5xy + \ln y$.
Compute the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$.

## Exercise

Let $f(x,y) = x^3 + 5 + e^{xy}$.
Calculate the gradient, $\nabla f$.

## Exercise
